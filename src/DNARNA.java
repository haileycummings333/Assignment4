public class DNARNA {
    /*
    Write a program that given a String representation of a DNA sequence and returns its transcribed RNA
sequence. The main differences that distinguish DNA from RNA is that RNA contains the sugar ribose,
while DNA contains the slightly different sugar deoxyribose (a type of ribose that lacks one oxygen
atom),
Constraints
• All characters in the DNA sequences ∈ {‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’, ‘T’}
Output Format
For each String, return (and print to console) the corresponding RNA sequence
Sample Input
