public class BalancedBrackets {
    /*
    A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].
Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a
closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {},
and ().
A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For
example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square
brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single,
unbalanced closing square bracket, ].
By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:
• It contains no unmatched brackets
• The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched
pair of brackets
Given a String of brackets, determine whether the sequence of brackets is balanced. If a String is balanced,
return YES. Otherwise, return NO.
Function Description: Write a function named isBalanced.
isBalanced has the following parameter(s):
• String s: a String of brackets
Returns
• String: either YES or NO
Input Format
A single String s will contain only a sequence of brackets. Can be empty.
Constraints
• 1 ≤ |𝑠| ≤ 10! , where |𝒔| is the length of the sequence
• All characters in the sequences ∈ { ‘{‘, ‘}’, ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘[‘, ‘]’ }
• You are allowed to use the LinkedList class but only the add(), remove(), and peek() methods
Output Format
For each String, return YES or NO
