public class Postfix {
    /*
    Given a String input containing an infix expression. Return a String output containing the equivalent
    postfix expression.
    Infix expression: The expression of the form a op b. When an operator is in-between every pair of
    operands.
    Postfix expression: The expression of the form a b op. When an operator is followed for every pair of
    operands.
    Note: The order of precedence is: ^ greater than * equals to / greater than + equals to -. Ignore the right
    associativity of ^.
    Hint:
    o If the scanned character is a ( , push it to the stack.
    o If the scanned character is a ) , pop the stack and output it until a ( is encountered, and discard both
    the parenthesis.
    Constraints
    â€¢ The input is guaranteed to be a valid expression
    sample Input
    a+b*(c^d-e)^(f+g*h)-i
    Sample Output
    abcd^e-fgh*+^*+i-
